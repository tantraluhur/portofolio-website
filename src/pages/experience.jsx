            To ensure efficient storage and deployment, I integrated the application with Google Cloud Storage 
            for storing image files and utilized Google Cloud App Engine for seamless deployment.
            This comprehensive system enables users to easily detect
            plant diseases and take appropriate measures for plant care."

            The application successfully processed over 100 registrations from enthusiastic users. 
            To ensure a seamless user experience, I implemented a responsive web design using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS, 
            allowing the application to adapt seamlessly across various devices. Furthermore, 
            I integrated backend APIs endpoints to fetch and manage data effectively,
